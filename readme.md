## 📝 Description

I am Md. Mahmood Hassan, a dedicated and detail-oriented Web Developer with a strong passion for building clean, functional, and user-focused digital experiences.

I believe websites should not only look good but also work flawlessly, load fast, and serve real business goals.

With hands-on experience in modern web technologies, I specialize in designing and developing responsive, scalable, and performance-optimized websites.

My development philosophy is simple:

- Clarity over clutter  
- Performance over decoration  
- Structure over chaos
